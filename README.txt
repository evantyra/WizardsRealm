An unfinished project for the moment named Wizards Realm. The goal of this
project will be to keep my coding skills tight while not taking a coding class
this semester, as well as practice new skills that I learned last semester.
This project was started February 12th, 2013.

My vision for the game is to create a 2D voxel based duel between two wizards,
one human, one AI (unless I look into networking.) The world will be
procedurally generated at the start of each fight, making each fight unique.
Spells will destroy, and create land making the playing field dynamic. I will
also try to work in a basic-ish water system to add more strategy.
